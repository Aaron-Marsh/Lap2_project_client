Now that you have added your habits you can track them! Use the plus and minus buttons to track your activities individually! The activities are coloured and ordered based on frequency, starting with daily habits and ending with monthly habits. The habits completed for the current time frame will change colour to green and will not be able to be modified until the next reset.
